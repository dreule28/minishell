# üêö minishell

A simplified UNIX shell built from scratch, mimicking key features of `bash`.  
This project was completed as part of the 42 curriculum.

## üß† Overview

Minishell replicates the core behavior of a POSIX shell:
- Reads and interprets user input
- Supports pipes, redirections, and environment expansion
- Executes built-in and external commands

We built the shell **without system shell functions like `system()`**, using only allowed low-level functions and syscalls.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### ‚úÖ Mandatory
- Prompt + working input history via `readline`
- Command parsing with proper quote handling (`'`, `"`)
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- Input/output redirections: `<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`
- Pipes (`|`) for multi-command pipelines
- Signal handling (`Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-\`)
- Built-in commands:
  - `echo -n`
  - `cd`
  - `pwd`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`

## üîÑ Parsing Logic [`@dreule`](https://github.com/dreule28) 

The parser handles:
- **Lexing**: splitting tokens while respecting quotes
- **Syntax tree construction**: recognizing pipes, redirections, and grouped operations
- **Quote removal & variable expansion**: compliant with bash-like rules
- **Error handling**: unclosed quotes, invalid syntax, etc.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Engine [`@gzovkic`](https://github.com/gzovkic)

The executor is responsible for:
- **Command resolution**: checking for builtins, absolute/relative paths, and $PATH lookup
- **Forking and piping**: creating child processes and wiring standard input/output via pipe(), dup2(), fork() and execve()
- **Redirection handling**: setting up input (<), output (>), append (>>), and heredoc (<<)
- **Builtin execution**: executing builtins without forking when appropriate (e.g., cd, export, exit)
- **Exit status tracking**: updating $? based on child status and pipeline outcomes
- **Signal management**: resetting signal handlers properly in parent vs child processes

## üöÄ How to Use

### üß± Build
```bash
make
```
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run
```bash
./minishell
```
Then try:

```bash
echo Hello World
echo $HOME
cat < infile | grep hello >> out.txt
```
## ‚å®Ô∏è Shell Behavior
| Action          | Behavior                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-C`        | Cancels current line and shows new prompt |
| `Ctrl-D`        | Exits shell if input is empty             |
| `Ctrl-\`        | Does nothing (interactive mode only)      |
| `cd ..`         | Changes directory                         |
| `export VAR=42` | Adds or updates environment variable      |
